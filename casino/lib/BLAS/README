BLAS
====

This directory contains those double-precision real and complex routines
in the BLAS library, levels 1, 2 and 3, required by CASINO. The Makefile
has been rewritten to fit into the CASINO Makefile system.

DO NOT MODIFY THESE ROUTINES. This will only break external-library support
and will complicate any upgrades that we may want to apply later on.

* In the event of a problem with a compiler, tweak FFLAGS_libs in
  CASINO/arch/data/$CASINO_ARCH.arch instead.

* If you need to use a new routine from the library, interface to it from
  the numerical.f90 module, and tweak the interface there to make it simpler
  to use from the higher-level module where it's needed. Contact PLR, he
  knows how to check for cross-dependencies and update the Makefile quickly.

The library in this directory is intended as a replacement for computers
which do not have pre-compiled, hardware-optimized BLAS libraries. The
provided library may be slower, but can be used on any computer. NB,
according to our initial tests, Intel's MKL and AMD's ACML perform poorly
compared to the provided library.

* To use the provided replacement, set HAVE_BLAS to 'no' in the include
  files. This should be the default for generic CASINO_ARCHs, and only extended
  CASINO_ARCHs should be configured otherwise.

* To use a pre-complied library, set HAVE_BLAS to 'yes' and add the
  appropriate '-L' and/or '-l' flags to LAPACK_yes in the include file for
  the extended CASINO_ARCH.

Development info
----------------

If you are in TCM, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc:

 source ~pl275/software/lapack.bashrc

which will add the LAPACK and BLAS manpages to your search path, so
you can type e.g. 'man dgeev' to get help in your terminal. Very useful!

Versions
--------
We have the BLAS distributed along with LAPACK 3.1.1 (February 2007).
