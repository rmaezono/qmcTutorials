To install 'billy'
==================

NB: If you are using 'billy' with the CASINO distribution, all of the setup
actions described below should be performed automatically by typing 'make'
in the CASINO/utils directory. Except it won't read the README file. Clearly.


(1) Set up the enclosed 'runcrystal' script by defining the environment
    variables at the top of the script. Billy uses this script directly to run
    CRYSTAL calculations (and so can you if you want). All environment issues
    such as what your CRYSTAL binaries are called and where your scratch
    directory is will be handled automatically by billy provided 'runcrystal'
    is set up correctly..

(2) In the billy/fortran directory you will find two fortran90 programs:
    helpbilly.f90 and helpbilly2.f90
    Compile them. Put the binaries (to be called helpbilly and helpbilly2)
    somewhere convenient (eg. your bin directory) and define their locations
    in the environment variable section at the top of the billy script.
    (I define a $CRYSTAL_ARCH environment variable defining the machine
    type and put things in ~/bin/$CRYSTAL_ARCH.)

(3) Go into the /fortran/dfit_source directory. Follow the instructions in the
    README file to make 'dfit'. Put the dfit binary somewhere in your path.
    Again, define its location at the top of the billy script.

(4) rehash

(5) Read the README file.

(6) That's it.

Any problems: mail mdt26@cam.ac.uk





NB: If billy doesn't work, it may be that the 'sort' command doesn't use the
correct syntax for your machine e.g.:

sort -n linefile -o linefile

should sort 'linefile' into increasing numeric order. This doesn't happen in
some csh dialects..
