Note from MDT to self:

* billy script doesn't appear to work in basis sets with parameters given
  in exponential notation. Fix.

To convert a number in exponential notation to ordinary notation, you
could use:

 set number = `echo $number | sed "s/+//g ; s/E/*10^/g ; s/e/*10^/g ;
s/d/*10^/g ; s/D/*10^/g" | bc -l`

(a more elegant method probably exists, but this method works.)
