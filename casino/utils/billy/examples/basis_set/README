How to optimize valence basis sets in the solid with billy
==========================================================

* Put a star next to all the parameters in the basis set you wish to optimize

* Run billy and wait.
In this case with billy -n 2 si 20, which will run the optimization twice
for additional accuracy.

* Note that core functions should be optimized with cheap atomic calculations
(see Mike Towler's 'atomicbilly' code)
