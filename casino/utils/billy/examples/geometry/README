To optimize the bond length in a methane molecule:
==================================================

CRYSTAL95 input file - methane

* Put ampersands in front of the three parameters specifying the bond length.
  (In this cases they are constrained to be equal to each other so we use
  ampersands rather than asterisks..)
* NB: You would use an asterisk to optimize a single lattice constant, for
  example.

The command 'billy methane 20' will then give

methane.log     - optimization report
methane.opt     - CRYSTAL input file with the optimized bond length
methane.opt_ast - as above, but maintaining the asterisks/ampersands.
                  (not important for this case, but useful time saver, if
                   we have lots of parameters, and want to optimize again.)
