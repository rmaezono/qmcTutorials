COMBINE utilities
=================

This directory contains utilities which allow one to combine wave
function parameter sets into a single set of parameter by averaging.

When optimizing a wave function, the first few (often just the first)
iterations move the parameters towards the region of the minimum, and
afterwards the parameters oscillate around the minimum without any
further convergence due to the numerics of the process. It turns out
that the values each parameter takes in this stage of the optimization
are normally distributed around the optimum value (J.R. Trail, to be
published), so it makes sense to simply average them to attempt to
produce the best wave function.

It is possible that correlations between different parameters could be
taken into account in order to improve the final estimate, but at present
the COMBINE utilities merely average the parameter values.

This directory currently contains only one combining utility,
COMBINE_CDATA.

COMBINE_CDATA
=============
This program averages parameters inside two or more correlation.data files.
On standard input it requires the name of the correlation.data files (the
first of which is taken as the reference) and an additional newline to
signal the end of the file list. It then produces a correlation.data file
on standard output. Note that the program communicates with the user
via standard error.

The command line to invoke this program should be:

 combine_cdata > cdata_final

and then the user would enter the names of the files, or more compactly:

 echo -e "cdata1\ncdata2\ncdata3\n" | combine_cdata > cdata_final 2> /dev/null
