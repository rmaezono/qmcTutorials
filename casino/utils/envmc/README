ENVMC
=====

This utility prints out the VMC energies in a set of CASINO output files. It
handles multiblock runs (where the blocks can be of different lengths) and
restarts, it prints variances, it performs format conversion and is capable of
analyzing the components of the local energy separately. Total and
block-average CPU times are displayed.

Usage:   envmc [-pe] [-kei] [-ti] [-fisq] [-vee] [-vei] [-vnl] 
               [-vr] [-rel] [-ct] [-nc] [-nf <no-figures>] [files]

If list-of-files is omitted, "./out" is assumed.

Options:
-------
-kei : Display KEI kinetic energy.
-ti  : Display TI kinetic energy.
-fisq: Display FISQ kinetic energy.
-pe  : Display potential energy.
-vee : Display e-e potential energy.
-vei : Display e-i potential energy if available.
-vnl : Display non-local e-i potential energy if available.
-vr  : Display virial ratio.
-rel : Display relativistic energy.
-ct  : Display correlation time.
-nc  : No colours. Display monochrome output. Use e.g. to dump results
       to a file.
-nf  : Number of figures. Display errorbars of <no-figures> figures.
       Setting <no-figures> to 0 disables format conversion.
