EXTRAPOLATE_TAU
!------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! This program enables the extrapolation of DMC energies to zero         !
! time step by fitting a polynomial form to the DMC energy as a          !
! function of time step, i.e. E = k1*tau^n1 + k2*tau^n2 + ...            !
! Note that the exponents n1, n2, ... do not need to be integers.        !
! One of them should be zero, however.                                   !
!                                                                        !
! The program will ask the user for the name of the file containing the  !
! energy against time step data.  The file should have either two or     !
! three columns holding, respectively, the time step, the DMC energy and !
! the statistical error bar in the DMC energy.                           !
