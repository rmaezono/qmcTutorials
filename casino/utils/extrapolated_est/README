 ! This program calculates the extrapolated estimator from 2   !
 ! data files, one DMC and one VMC. If both sets have          !
 ! errorbars, these will be combined in the usual way.         !
 !                                                             !
 ! The extrapolated estimator is 2g_DMC-g_VMC - see manual for !
 ! details.                                                    !
 !                                                             !
 ! The files will be checked to ensure that they have the same !
 ! numbers of lines, sets of errorbars and x-coords.           !
 !                                                             !
 ! One can produce the required input files by using           !
 ! PLOT_EXPVAL in a directory containing expval.data           !
