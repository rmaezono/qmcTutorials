FORMAT_CONFIGS
--------------
Format a binary config.in file and make it into a readable
config.in_formatted file (or vice versa)..

Make sure only one of config.in or config.in_formatted is present in the
current directory and type 'format_configs'. The utility will then convert
whichever file it is into the other one.
