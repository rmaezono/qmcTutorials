GRAPHDMC
--------
Utility which reads the dmc.hist file and calls the plotting programs xmgr,
xmgrace or gnuplot. This requires at least one of these to be set up on your
machine:

 http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/
 http://www.gnuplot.info/

Syntax:
 graphdmc -h|--help
 graphdmc [-g|--gnuplot] [-x|--fixnums] [<hist-file>]

'graphdmc' produces 2 plots. The plot above shows the population against the
number of moves, and the plot below shows the local energy, reference
energy and the best estimate of the energy against the number of moves.

If the '-x|--fixnums' option is supplied, graphdmc will copy the dmc.hist file
to dmc.hist.temp first, adding an additional first column which gives the
line number. The dmc.hist file normally has this already of course, but
sometimes it is convenient to snip out chunks of data to improve the
statistics, in which case graphdmc -x will still produce a nice plot
whereas graphdmc won't. This option may also be used to plot very old
formats of dmc.hist where the continuous line numbering was not included.

If the '-g|--gnuplot' is supplied, graphdmc will try to use gnuplot by
default, rather than xmgrace.

If the PLOTTER environment variable is defined and points to a valid 
binary of xmgrace or gnuplot, graphdmc will use this binary. This may 
be useful if binary has a non-standard name or is not in the $PATH 
environment variable. This might be used as follows:

PLOTTER="/path/to/grace/grace5.1.1" graphdmc

Specifying "-g" will always override the PLOTTER environment variable. 
To force the use of a version of gnuplot that has a non-standard name 
or is not on the $PATH, define the PLOTTER variable explicitly, without
including the "-g" flag.

Note that this utility used to be called 'graphit' - hence the symlink 
in this directory for those who can't break the habit.
