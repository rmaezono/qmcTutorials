MCTA_POST_PROCESS and MCTA_HF
=============================
This directory contains tools for the post-processing of Monte Carlo
twist averaged (MCTA) VMC and DMC data for the homogeneous electron
gas.  This post-processing technique corrects the error bar of the
energy by:
  (1) subtracting multiples of the Hartree-Fock (HF) kinetic and
      exchange energies from the local energies at each twist angle,
  (2) reblocking the resulting set of modified local energies, and
  (3) adding multiples of very accurate MCTA values of the HF kinetic
      and exchange energies.
See below for an overview of the control variate scheme that this
method uses.

Post-processed error bars are expected to be smaller than those
obtained without post-processing; reduction factors of between 1.5 and
50 have been seen in practice.

The MCTA_HF utility is a parallel tool which calculates the MCTA-HF
energy of a HEG with the requested accuracy.  The output of MCTA_HF
is required to run MCTA_POST_PROCESS.

The MCTA_POST_PROCESS utility is a Fortran implementation of the
post-processing algorithm, which reads the CASINO output files, asks
for the MCTA-HF energy components and produces the post-processed
result.


MCTA_HF
=======

Usage
-----
MCTA_HF is a parallel utility, which can be run via mpirun, e.g.,

  mpirun -np 4 mcta_hf

The utility can be used in clusters with batch queuing systems, in
which case a submission script appropriately invoking mcta_hf should
be written.  One can also run the utility directly without mpirun to
perform a single-processor calculation.

MCTA_HF reads the system parameters from standard input, and it can
compute the MCTA-HF energies of several systems in a single run.
This makes the utility well suited for use on clusters.


Example
-------
Suppose we want to calculate the MCTA-HF energy of a 54-electron gas
in an fcc lattice at rs=5 a.u. with an error bar of 5*10^-7 a.u./part.
or less using 2 MPI processes.  We would do:

Multiple-system example
-----------------------

In this example we write the input to be read by the utility to a file,
then run the utility.  In addition to the above system, we also compute
the MCTA-HF energy of a 602-electron gas in a 2D square lattice at rs=2
a.u. with an error bar of 5*10^-7 a.u./part. or less, and we use 4 MPI
processes.

Capabilities
------------
MCTA_HF can:
- Be used to compute the MCTA-HF energy of homogeneous systems in
  1, 2 and 3 dimensions with any cell shape.
- Be used to compute the MCTA-HF kinetic energy of homogeneous systems
  with a non-Ewald interaction (by ignoring the reported exchange
  energy).
- Be used to compute the MCTA-HF energy of biwires / bilayers, ignoring
  the capacitor term (since it is independent of the separation d).


MCTA_POST_PROCESS
=================

Usage
-----
MCTA_POST_PROCESS should be run under a directory containing the
CASINO 'out' file and the 'vmc.hist' or 'dmc.hist' file corresponding
to the calculation that requires post-processing.

MCTA_POST_PROCESS will ask the user to interactively enter the MCTA-HF
kinetic and exchange energies (from MCTA_HF, see above), and it will
then go on to report the total energy and the correlation energy.


Example
-------
Suppose we have run a VMC calculation of a 54-electron gas in a simple
cubic cell at rs=1, for which MCTA_HF gives the MCTA-HF energy
components:
  K =  1.10732606689554  +/- 9.849401012527091E-007
  X = -0.487091388553644 +/- 1.726966885629877E-007
We would then run:

--

$ mcta_post_process

   dE_unprocessed / dE_final = 30.57221

Capabilities
------------
MCTA_POST_PROCESS can:
- Be applied to data from calculations of homogeneous systems in 1, 2
  and 3 dimensions with any cell shape.
- Be applied to data from calculations using interactions other than
  the Ewald interaction (the utility simply ignores the HF exchange
  energy in these cases).

MCTA_POST_PROCESS cannot:
- Be applied to calculations performed over multiple continuation
  runs; a single "out" file with the entire set of twist angles needs
  to be crafted from the multiple "out" files for the utility to be
  able to load the required data.


Post-processing methodology
===========================
The post-processing algorithm is based on a control variate technique
described in Ref. [1].  In this technique, the local energy is
modified by subtracting a function F of the twist angle,

  E_mod(R,k) = E_L(R,k) - F({a};k) .

F is called the control variate.  The parameters {a} in F can then be
optimized so as to minimize the variance of E_mod.

In the case of MCTA calculations in a HEG, the shifts in the local
energy when k changes correlate well with a linear combination of
the kinetic (K) and exchange (X) HF energies, so we use

  F(a,b;k) = a*K(k) + b*X(k)

as the control variate.  a and b are obtained by minimizing the
variance of E_mod.

Note that obtaining a and b by minimizing the variance of the same
sample that the control variate method is to be applied to gives rise
to a potential negative bias in the variance.  This bias has been
found to be small in practice, and it should be negligible for large
data sets.  Also, MCTA_POST_PROCESS computes a and b using a blocking
method which should help reduce this bias, giving error estimates on
a and b in the process.
