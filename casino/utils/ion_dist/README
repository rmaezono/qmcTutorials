ION_DIST
========

Program for automatic generation of the 'edist_by_ion' block in the input file
for CASINO. Currently works only for antiferromagnetic Wigner crystals that
have been generated by the CRYSTAL program (since the numbers are generated
from an analysis of the gwfn.data file).

The required input for this keyword block can require lots of numbers (see
below) and is used to tell the 'points.f90' routine how many electrons
to associate with each ion in its initial random distribution (normally
each ion is awarded a certain number of electrons distributed
in proportion to the valence charge of the ion. The simulations begins with
these electrons arranged randomly on the surface of a sphere surrounding each
ion).

In magnetic crystals the points routine will not usually get the spins right.
Normally, one would expect this to be equilibrated out in real magnetic
systems, but antiferromagnetic Wigner crystals are a particular problem
since the values of the up-spin orbitals in the region of a down spin site
(and vice versa) are effectively zero. This may cause the Slater Matrix to
immediately become singular. Hence edist_by_ion, and this utility.

NDD/MDT 8.2002

e.g. antiferromagnetic bcc Wigner crystal with CRYSTAL 8 'atom' primitive cell
with 888k plucked to 222k -----> CASINO 8*2*2*2=64 'atom' super cell.
This requires a particular spin pattern of 32 up and 32 down spin electrons
which ion_dist deduces from analyzing the CRYSTAL output from reading the
ATOMSPIN block.
