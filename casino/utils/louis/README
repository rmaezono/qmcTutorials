A program to propagate quantum particles in a box using de Broglie-Bohm
dynamics (and appropriate generalizations).

Program will plot single trajectories, calculate time-dependent densities, 
psi squared, and H functions.

The following citation (quoted in full) is required in any publication
describing results obtained from LOUIS :

Since June 2013, LOUIS has been distributed as a utility included with
the distribution of the CASINO quantum Monte Carlo code, as its ability
to study quantum trajectories has some relevance to proposed new QMC 
algorithms.

QUICK GUIDE TO USE
==================

INSTALLATION
------------

LOUIS uses the CASINO architecture system so should set up and run 
automatically on any machine that CASINO supports.

If you want to compile the debug, prof, or dev versions you need to type
'make debug/make prof/make dev' in the louis subdirectory, rather than
using the CASINO generic utils Makefile (which deliberately doesn't handle 
'features').

RUNNING THE CODE
----------------
Type 'runlouis' in a directory containing a LOUIS 'input' file. If you have
set up the path correctly, then neither the 'runlouis' script nor the
'louis' fortran binary need to be in the current directory.

Type 'runlouis --help' to see the full list of command line options, which are
basically the same as those of 'runqmc'. On a parallel machine, type e.g. 
'runlouis -p 512' to run on 512 cores.

Example input files in LOUIS/examples for 1D/2D/3D cases.

To learn about any input file keyword, type 'louishelp <name of keyword>'.

The code can be run in 'trajectory mode' (very fast, will only use 1 core)
to study individual quantum trajectories, or 'density mode' to study the
evolution the density of particles obeying deBB dynamics (much slower,
especially in 3D, generally requires parallel machine).

VISUALIZING THE RESULTS
-----------------------

The script 'plot_louis' will plot pretty pictures or movies from your data.
[Requires python and gnuplot to be installed]. See also 'louisplot2d' and
'louisplot3d'.

See the manual for more detailed stuff.
