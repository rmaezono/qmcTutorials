# This script allows the LOUIS administrator to simultaneously modify all     #
# the many input files in the LOUIS examples directory in various ways,       #
# reflecting changes in the list of keywords understood by LOUIS.             #
# The current list ofthings this script can do is :                           #

# (1) Change the default value of a keyword from x to y.                      #
# (2) Delete a keyword completely.                                            #
# (3) Add a new keyword together with its default and closing blurb.          #
# (4) Substitute every occurence of a phrase with another phrase.      
#                                                                             #

# This script is written in bash as various people keep whingeing at me to    #
