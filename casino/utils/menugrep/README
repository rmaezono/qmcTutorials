Menugrep
========
PLR 08.2005

This util invokes grep and displays the result in a menu, from which
the user can select a specific line in a file to edit straight away
using vim.

Usage: menugrep [-w] [-c] <pattern> [<files>]

* -w invokes grep -w (<pattern> is a complete word rather than a part).

* -c disables smart-case matching (i.e., enables fully case-sensitive
  searches). Note: 'smart-case' means that when a lower-case pattern
  is provided, the search is case-insensitive, and when any upper-case
  letter is present, the search becomes case-sensitive. This is an
  issue if the user wishes to search for lower-case patterns, in which
  case the -c flag ought to be used.

Examples
--------
* To look for 'debug' (arbitrary capitalization) in *.f90:

  menugrep debug *.f90

* To look specifically for 'DEBUG':

  menugrep DEBUG *.f90

* To look specifically for 'debug':

  menugrep -c debug *.f90

* To look for 'DeBuG' as an isolated word:

  menugrep -w DeBuG *.f90
