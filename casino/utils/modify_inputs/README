# This script allows the CASINO administrator to simultaneously modify all    #
# the hundreds of input files in the CASINO examples directory in various     #
# ways, reflecting changes in the list of keywords understood by CASINO.      #
# The current list ofthings this script can do is :                           #
#                                                                             #
# (1) Change the default value of a keyword from x to y.                      #
# (2) Delete a keyword completely.                                            #
# (3) Add a new keyword together with its default and closing blurb.          #
#                                                                             #
# Usage : type 'modify_inputs' and follow the prompts.                        #

# This script is written in bash as various people keep whingeing at me to    #
# do this, as csh shell scripts are apparently nasty and old fashioned.       #

# This is the only CASINO utility that was written on an aeroplane (from      #
