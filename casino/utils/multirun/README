MULTIRUN
--------

MULTIRUN is a script to run several CASINO runs sequentially changing any set
of parameters from an user-provided input file. Output files for these runs
are kept in io/<run-num>. All files required by all runs must be present in
the directory under which MULTIRUN is run. File 'input' must contain all
parameters the user wishes to vary.

SYNTAX
------

multirun [--check] [runqmc-options] -- <param> <list> [<separator> <param>
                                                       <list> [...]]

 Where:

* --check        : tells multirun to build and print the list of runs
                   requested, but not to execute them.
* runqmc-options : options to be passed to runqmc
* --             : this separator is mandatory
* <param>        : a parameter (which must be present in ./input) which the
                   user wants to vary
* <list>         : several formats are available:

  -l <list-of-values>

    <param> takes the values supplied after -l

  -f <filename> <column> [<skip-lines> [<num-of-lines>]]

    <param> takes the values listed in column <column> of file <filename> from
    line <skip-lines>+1 to <skip-lines>+<num-of-lines>. By default,
    <skip-lines>=0 and <num-of-lines> is the number of lines in the file.

  -fit <from> <+|-><incr> <to>

    <param> takes the numeric values that lie between From and To and are
    separated by Incr. NB, <from> <= <param> < <to>+<incr>. <param> may
    exceed <to> <to>-<from>/<incr> is not an integer. The sign +/- before
    <incr> is mandatory.

  -fin <from> <+|-><incr> <num-of-values>

    <param> takes <num-of-values> numeric values starting from <from> and
    increasing by <incr>. The sign +/- before <incr> is mandatory.

* <separator>    : this can be used to make two or more adjacent parameters
                   vary together (<separator> is '+') or independently
                   (<separator> is -).

A log file will be kept in ./multirun.log, which includes info about which
runs are in which directories and a copy of STDERR/STDOUT.


EXAMPLE
-------

If we wanted to study how single variance minimization runs perform
with/without weights with increasing number of configs, we would need to
increase NMOVE and NWRCON at the same time, while turning VMREWEIGHT on and
off independently. We should type:

 multirun -- nmove -fit 1000 +1000 10000 + nwrcon -fin 1000 +1000 10
  - vmreweight -l T F

This generates 20 variance minimization runs:

 nmove : 1000   nwrcon : 1000   vmreweight : T
 nmove : 2000   nwrcon : 2000   vmreweight : T
 ...
 nmove : 10000  nwrcon : 10000  vmreweight : T
 nmove : 1000   nwrcon : 1000   vmreweight : F
 nmove : 2000   nwrcon : 2000   vmreweight : F
 ...
 nmove : 10000  nwrcon : 10000  vmreweight : F

* Note that the order in which parameters are entered is kept: first given,
  first varied.
* The '+' before NWRCON is what makes it change at the same time as NMOVE.
  The number of values both of these parameters take must be the same.
* The '-' before VMREWEIGHT makes it independent of the others.
