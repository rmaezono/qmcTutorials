PERCENT_CALCULATOR
==================
This is a little calculator utility.  When run, it asks the user for two
reference values (possibly with errorbars), each corresponding to 0% and
100% in some useful scale.  Then the user can enter a series of values
(possibly with errorbars), each of which is converted into a percentage
between the two reference values and printed.

This utility can be used to calculate the percentage of correlation energy
achieved by a QMC calculation by using the HF energy and the exact energy as
references.

The program understands values and errorbars given in one if the following
four formats:
[1] 1.2345 0.0006      [first is value, second is errorbar]
[2] 1.2345 +/- 0.0006  [actually any string is allowed between both numbers]
[3] 1.2345             [errorbar is understood to be zero]
[4] 1.2345(6)

It also understands the following formats for easy copy/pasting from LaTeX:
 1&2345
 1&2345(6)
 $1$&$2345$
 $1$&$2345(6)$
This list is not exhaustive; the input string is in fact pre-processed by
removing all '$' signs and converting all '&' to '.'.  Also note that '\pm'
is allowed in format [2] above.

The percentages are printed in the same format the values are input, except
for any LaTeX formatting, and for the fact that type-[3]-formatted values are
converted to type-[4]-formatted percentages if the errorbar in the percentage
is non-zero (happens if the references have non-zero errorbars).
