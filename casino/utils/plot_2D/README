PLOT_2D
=======

This utility uses gnuplot to produce a colour map of a function
produced by qmc_plot or plot_expval in 2D (or 3D) modes.

Syntax:
------

2D_plot [-ps|-eps|-png|-jpeg] [--reverse] [--symmetric] [-nodes nodes_file]
        [-parts parts_file] [2Dplot_file]

Options explained:
-----------------

[-ps|-eps|-png|-jpeg] -> Write output in one of these formats
[-nodes nodes_file]   -> This will plot the wf nodes contained in nodes_file
                         (as produced by qmc_plotter) on top of the colour map.
[-parts parts_file]   -> This will display the positions of the particles on
                         top of the graph. These must be pasted from 'out'
                         into parts_file (particle positions are only given
                         for 'energy', 'wfn' and 'nodes' plots)
[--reverse]           -> Reverse the colour gradient. Useful in some wfn
                         plots, as the phase is arbitrary. Also '-r'
[-xy|-xz|-yz]         -> Plot function versus XY, XZ or YZ. This ought to
                         match the plane in which the plot was originally
                         generated. Default is '-xy'.
[-surf]               -> Plots 3D surface grid thing with peaks as well
                         as the 2D pm3d colour contour map.
[-noscale]            -> Don't scale the data by looking at min and max values.
                         Often looks better than the default.
[2Dplot_file]         -> Data file. Default is 2Dplot.dat .

Notes:
-----

* 3D plots will be treated as 2D plots and the resulting graph (if
  gnuplot does not crash) would correspond to the last layer of the
  volume. There is no volume-to-plane projection feature.

CHANGES
-------
MDT 05.2006 - added -surf and -noscale options.
