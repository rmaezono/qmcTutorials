PLOT_BF scripts
===============
These scripts use GNUplot to display the backflow displacement
vector field on a test electron, as produced by using the input
block plot_backflow (see `casinohelp plot_backflow` for info).
GNUplot must hence be installed and available in a directory
specified in the PATH environment variable.

It is possible to modify the graph using the mouse and keybord
as indicated by the on-screen help of the scripts. If specified,
a .ps/.eps/.png/.jpg file can be written on exit.

PLOT_BFFIELD
============
The data contained in bffield.dat is plotted in 2D (the z-component
is dropped). Notice that the backflow dispacement vector field in
this file is renormalized so that it is easier to get a global
picture of the field. Generally, the actual displacements are much
smaller.

The file bffield.dat is compulsory. The data from bfconfig.dat and
bfions.dat will be loaded if present.

Usage: plot_bffield [-ps|-eps|-png|-jpeg] [bffield_file]

A sample 'bffield.eps' is given in the current directory (use e.g. 'gv'
to view this file).

PLOT_BFPHI
==========
This utility does the same as bffield, but displays only the
contribution to the backflow displacement of one set and spin-pair
of the Phi term.

The file bfphi_<s>_<set>.dat is compulsory. The input file is used
to determine the position of the fixed electron i, and, if not present,
the user is asked to supply it. If not supplied, the position of the
fixed electron is not plotted.

Usage: plot_bfphi [-ps|-eps|-png|-jpeg] [bfphi_file]

A sample 'bfphi.eps' is given in the current directory (use e.g. 'gv'
to view this file).
