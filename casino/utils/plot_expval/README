PLOT_EXPVAL
===========

MDT 11.2005

This routine allows you to produce 1D, 2D, 3D plots of the various
expectation values that CASINO can calculate which get stored in the file
'expval.data'.

The current list of expectation values which this utility can handle is :

 (1)  density
 (2)  spin density
 (3)  spin density matrix (NOT YET)
 (4)  reciprocal space pair-correlation function
 (5)  spherical pair correlation function
 (6)  localization tensor (NOT YET)
 (7)  structure factor
 (8)  spherically-averaged structure factor
 (9)  one-particle density matrix
 (10) two-particle density matrix
 (11) condensate fraction estimator (unbiased TBDM, goes as TBDM-OBDM**2)
 (12) momentum density
 (13) dipole moment

In cases where the plot_geometry is not clear from the context (i.e.
everything apart from spherical PCF and spherical structure factors), then
control of the plot is performed through the 'plot_expval' block in
input (this is ignored during a normal CASINO run). The structure of this block
is as follows :

 LINE 1: dimensionality of plot ndim 1/2/3, OR EQUIVALENTLY, line/plane/volume
 LINE 2: No. of points along each of the ndim directions
 LINE 3: xyz coords of point A
 LINE 4: xyz coords of point B
 LINE 5: xyz coords of point C (if reqd.)
 LINE 6: xyz coords of point D (if reqd.).

assuming the geometrical region on which the function is plotted is a
line AB / plane AB-AC / volume AB-AC-AD. The data will be plotted in a
format suitable for xmgr/grace in the file 'lineplot.dat' or in a format
suitable for gnuplot in '2Dplot.dat' or '3Dplot.dat'. Visualize the latter
using the plot_2D CASINO utility which calls gnuplot with all the
right options.
