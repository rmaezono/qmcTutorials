PLOT_MPC
========

MDT 5.2006

This routine allows you to produce real space plots of the quantities stored
in Fourier space in the mpc.data file, namely :

1. the SCF density calculated from the input trial wave function
2. 1/r (NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)

Control of the plot is performed through the 'plot_expval' block in
input (this is ignored during a normal CASINO run).

The structure of this block is as follows :

 LINE 1: dimensionality of plot ndim 1/2/3, OR EQUIVALENTLY, line/plane/volume
 LINE 2: No. of points along each of the ndim directions
 LINE 3: xyz coords of point A
 LINE 4: xyz coords of point B
 LINE 5: xyz coords of point C (if reqd.)
 LINE 6: xyz coords of point D (if reqd.).

assuming the geometrical region on which the function is plotted is a
line AB / plane AB-AC / volume AB-AC-AD. The data will be plotted in a
format suitable for xmgr/grace in the file 'lineplot.dat' or in a format
suitable for gnuplot in '2Dplot.dat' or '3Dplot.dat'. Visualize the latter
using the plot_2D CASINO utility which calls gnuplot with all the
right options.
