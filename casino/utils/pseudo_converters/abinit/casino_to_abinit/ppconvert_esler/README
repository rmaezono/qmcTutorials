ppconvert 0.1
-------------

ppconvert is a simple C++ tool to convert nonlocal pseudopotentials in
CASINO's native format into formats usable by other codes.  At present,
it can convert into ABINIT's Troullier-Martins format or into the XML
standard format defined by the FSAtom consortium.  The action of the
program is entirely specified on the command line.

Input options
-------------
  --casino_pot fname
       This required argument specifies the name of the
       psuedopotential file in CASINO format
  --casino_us fname
       This specifies the name of the file from which to read the
       s-channel (l=0) radial wave function, which is needed to
       construct projectors for transformation into the
       Kleinman-Bylander separable form.  The files should be in the
       CASINO awfn.data format.
  --casiso_up fname
       Same as above, but for the p-channel (l=1)
  --casiso_ud fname
       Same as above, but for the d-channel (l=2)

Output options
--------------
  --xml fname
       Write the pseudopotential in the standard XML format defined by
       FSAtom.
  --tm fname
       Write the pseudopotenial in the Troullier-Martins form for
       use in ABINIT.

Example usage
-------------
The following converts the CASINO Dirac-Fock potential, b_pp.data.DF,
into XML and ABINIT Troullier-Martin format.  It reads the radial
functions for the projections from two different files: the s and p
projectors are taken from awfn.data_s2p1_2P and the d is take from
awfn.data_s2d1_2D.

ppconvert --casino_pot b_pp.data.DF --casino_us "awfn.data_s2p1_2P"      \
          --casino_up "awfn.data_s2p1_2P" --casino_ud "awfn.data_s2d1_2D"\
          --xml BoronDF_PP3.xml --tm BoronDF_PP.tm

CAVEAT EMPTOR
-------------
This code currently allows the user to pull the radial functions used
for Kleinman-Bylander projections from different files.  The author is
not certain whether it is permissable to take these radial wave
functions from different reference configurations.  Use with care.
This code has been used by the author, but has not yet been
extensively tested.  Please report any problems to kpesler@gmail.com.
