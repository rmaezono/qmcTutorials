champ_to_casino_pp
------------------

Converts CHAMP pseudopotential format to CASINO pseudopotential format.

CHAMP is Cyrus Umrigar and Claudia Filippi's QMC code. See:

http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~cyrus/champ.html

CHAMP PSEUDOPOTENTIAL FORMAT:
-----------------------------

Distances in bohr, energies in hartree.

Arbitrary number of comments at the top beginning with #

First line:

number of pseudopotential components, effective nuclear charge, r_asymp

Second line:

grid type, no. of grid points, first radius, exponent, exponential of exponent

where grid type=1/2/3 implies linear/exponential/shifted exponential grid
(since the r values are given explicitly, this information is redundant).

Subsequent lines:

radius followed by the components of the pseudopotential in order of increasing
L. Note each component is the full pseudopotential (not the difference from
the local component), so each component goes asymptotically to -Z_val/r.

The identity of the local component is specified in the CHAMP input file (and
arbitrarily assigned to the highest angular momentum by this converter).
