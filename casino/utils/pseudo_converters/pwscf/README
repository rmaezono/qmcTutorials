Pseudopotentials in PWSCF and CASINO
====================================

http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

DFT trial wave functions produced by the PWSCF code (part of the Quantum
Espresso distribution) must be generated using the same pseudopotential
as in the subsequent QMC calculation. This requires the use of tools
to switch between the different file formats used by the two codes.

[It should be noted that ultrasoft and PAW pseudopotentials cannot be used
with the CASINO code.]

CASINO uses the 'CASINO tabulated format', PWSCF officially supports the UPF
(version 2) format (though it will read other 'deprecated' formats).

There are two options for switching between the various file formats.

(1) casino2upf/upf2casino (written by Simon Binnie)
---------------------------------------------------

Converts CASINO tabulated format to and from UPF version 2 (UPFv2) format.

This is included in the Quantum Espresso distribution (see directory upftools).

In the CASINO distribution, see also the README and INSTRUCTIONS files in the
utils/pseudo_converters/pwscf/casino2upf directory.

(2) casino2gon (written by John Trail)
--------------------------------------

Converts CASINO tabulated format to the (deprecated) GON format.

This is included in the utils/pseudo_converters/pwscf/casino2gon directory
in the CASINO distribution.


Which utility to use?
=====================

Since UPFv2 is the current official format for PWSCF, one would normally
use the casino2upf converter (though as of 3.2011 PWSCF will still read
GON files).

The casino2gon alternative is useful when you need to do interpolation -
i.e. use have a non-standard grid or wave functions on a different grid.

In particular it can take pp_gaussian or pp_gamess as input as well as pp.data
