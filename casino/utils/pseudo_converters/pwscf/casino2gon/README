CASINO2GON utility
==================

JRT 2009

Convert CASINO pseudopotentials for input into the PWSCF program
----------------------------------------------------------------

casino2gon needs an input file, 'awfn.inp', to specify what is converted and
how, and puts results in file 'ppot.gon' for PWSCF to use (note this GON
file format is currently deprecated, and may become unsupported in a future
release of PWSCF). It also needs files from the CASINO website.

A example awfn.inp file is:

1:# atom,Zval,Zgrid,xmin,dx,nrgrid
2:Zn    12.00000000    30.00000000    -7.00000000     0.01250000 1000
3:0                                       ! local channel
4:   0    2.00000000                      ! GS occupation of s-channel
5:   1    0.00000000                      ! GS occupation of p-channel
6:   2   10.00000000                      ! GS occupation of d-channel
7:"./zn/2/pp_gaussian"                    ! path to pseudopotential file
8:"./zn/1/awfn.data_d10s2_1S"             ! path to projectors
9:"./zn/1/awfn.data_d10s1p1_3P"           ! path to projectors

Line number
1: Just a comment. Ignore.
2: Name of atom , Pseudo Z value , Zgrid , xmin , dx , nrgrid
   The last 4 describe the grid that PWSCF uses, r(i)=exp[xmin/Zgrid+(i-1)*dx]
   with i=1..nrgrid.
   As a rule of thumb, use values above but:
    Use Zgrid=atomic number of the atom calculated.
    Change dx if maximum radius reported by the code is less than 6 or greater
    than 10.
3: Channel that PWSCF is told to use as local
4:  Occupation numbers
5:  of the
6:  pseudoatom GS.
7: Path to CASINO pseudopotential file. Can be a pp.data, or a pp_gaussian file.
8: Path to GS awfn.data file, supplies projectors.
9: Path to a second awfn.data file, etc
   There can be any number of awfn.data files listed at the end, and the
   converter uses orbitals in a first-come-first-served order, ie for the
   above file the s and d projectors come from "./zn/1/awfn.data_d10s2_1S",
   and the p projector comes from "./zn/1/awfn.data_d10s1p1_3P".

Problems
--------

Two problems appear repeatedly with PWSCF and other plane wave calculations:

A) problem : Ghost states appear
   solution: Make the s-channel local, not the d-channel

B) problem : Needs a massive E_cut, and convergence is unstable
   solution: Use the 'new' small-core pseudopotentials on the webpage for
   1st row transitions
   (eg numbers 8&9 in www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mdt26/pseudo_lib/zn/pseudo.html)

 That's all it takes.
 If you do (A) ghost states disappear. If you do (B) you need a lot fewer
 plane waves (cost is 6 more valence electrons per transition atom).

 See CASINO/utils/pseudo_converters/NOTES for some more thoughts on this issue.

 The casino2gon converter can only use website HF orbitals for the KB
 projectors, and provides an old format of file (GON not UPF) so the casino2upf
 converter supplied with the Quantum Espresso distribution would probably be a
 better choice for most people, as long as you do (A) and (B) above.

Examples
--------

 In this directory are some examples for converting Fe pseudopotential files
 to ppot.gon files. (1) uses solution A and B, (2) uses solution A only (i.e.
 converts the 'old' large-core pseudopotentials) and (3) uses neither solution.
 A test is to compare original HF pseudoatom energy with a PWSCF atom-in-a-box
 calculation (LDA, (10a_0)^3 unit cell, 1 kpt at origin, 100 Ry. cutoff) - they
 should be different, but not by much. For Fe this gives:

Example       E_HF                 E_pwscf
(1)        -177.22094           -178.82155332  successful
(2)         -42.53476            -33.30939245  no ghost states, but needs a
                                               bigger E_cut (not converged)
(3)         -42.53476           -203.21877497  a ghost state, so useless

 Rest of 1st row transitions behave the same - small-core ppots with s-local
 give:
              E_HF                 E_pwscf
sc          -58.11932            -59.27481536
ti          -75.14934            -76.45267348
v           -95.35388            -32.35608974
cr         -119.39496           -120.79262612
mn         -146.42622           -147.79751987
fe         -177.25648           -178.82155332
co         -212.21002           -213.94393377
ni         -253.56842           -253.65546909
cu         -295.33914           -296.49501195
zn         -343.10286           -343.47556881

 Large-core ppots with s-local need a bigger basis set - for 100 Ry. cutoff
 atom-in-a-box is often not large enough. Large-core with d-local give a ghost
 state.

 Final point - it is usually best to have projectors for all non-local
 channels. Most plane-wave codes miss some out when they calculate their own
 KSDFT projectors from GS
