CASINO2UPF
----------

The fortran routines here are copies of the relevant routines of the CASINO
pseudopotential utility supplied with the PWSCF/Quantum Espresso distribution.
These are provided for information only, and unlike casino2gon this is not a
standalone functional utility (since it INCLUDEs lots of espresso modules not
given here).

You must download and install Quantum Espresso in order to use this utility:

Full instructions for use are given in the INSTRUCTIONS file in this directory
- this is a partial copy of the README file in the uptools directory of the
  Espresso distribution (which may have been updated since I copied it - do
check..).
