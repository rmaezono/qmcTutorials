                 PTM - pseudopotential data transformer
                        Mike Towler, Sep 1999
========================================================================

NB: August 2000 - rewritten to handle new style CASINO x_pp.data format.
Old version of ptm maintained in directory 'old'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: Type 'ptm' and answer the questions.

Takes as input either:
(1) Up to 5 pp components on a radial grid in new QMC x_pp.data format
or
(2) Fit file containing gaussian exponents, coefficients and powers of r

The fit file should be in the following format (with the freedom that
order of coefficients and exponents can be reversed (Program detects
automatically which it is from occurence of negative numbers).

PTM cam perform the following transformations on x_pp.data files:
(1) Multiply or divide data by a power of r
(2) Calculate differences between different components to work out
    non-local projections
(3) Convert to xmgr format

and the following transformations on the fit file
(1) perform the Gaussian expansion and plot results on radial grid
wth options to subtract Z/r and to convert between Hartree and Rydbergs
The result can be plotted as x_pp.data or xmgr plot.
