Subject: ptm for dummies

Dear Mike

after couple of months of soft work, and ten days of hard work, i am now able
to use ptm for translating any pseudo from crystal (or other gaussian  
fit) to Casino.

I write for me some instructions. Please tell me if are correct, and  
if yes and if you want give them in some way to the users.

I tested the following procedure on several PP taken from CASINO web site.

I enclose picture of the PP tables got from Casino site, and of the  
tables built  from the corresponding gaussian fits.

Transformation of Pseudo-Potential gaussian fit into table form, as QMC input
using ptm

Case 1: My potential has a local component
------------------------------------------

Check each step using the xmgrace graphical representation

- It is logical to put the local component as the third one, reserved  
to d component (Vd)

- Using ptm transform the gaussian fit into tables; subtract Z/r only  
to the local component Vd.

- Using ptm edit the first 2 components, substituting Vs with Vs+Vd  
and Vp with Vp+Vd, using the enclosed modified ptm.f90 (that sums also  
the components). The reason for that is that Casino wants the total PP  
for each components, including the local one, and including -Z/r.

- Edit again the PP tables using ptm, multiplying them times r.

This is the input for Casino.

Case 2: My potential has not a local component
----------------------------------------------

Check each step using the xmgrace graphical representation

- Using ptm transform the gaussian fit into tables; subtract Z/r to  
all 3 components Vs, Vp, Vd

- Edit again the PP tables using ptm, multiplying them times r.

This is the input for Casino.
