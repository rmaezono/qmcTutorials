! Program for carrying out a quadratic fit to a set of data, in order     !
! to find a local extremum.                                               !
!                                                                         !
! Data file should consist of two or three columns of data, which         !
! are the (x,y) or (x,y +/- sigma_y) points to which the fit is           !
! made. If two columns are given then the program will perform a least-   !
! squares fit to the (x,y) data; if three columns are given then a        !
! chi^2 fit to the (x,y +/- sigma_y) will be performed.                   !
