REBLOCKING UTILITY
------------------

You have some set of random data with a mean and a standard error. The means
are easy to calculate but the standard error depends on the block size.
Reblock will compute the standard error for a range of block sizes and
also compute the mean values of the total energy and its components.

Requires as input a vmc.hist or dmc.hist file as produced by CASINO VMC and DMC
calculations.

Reblock will also plot graphs of standard error vs. block size (visualize using
the plot_reblock script).

Note that CASINO itself will compute reblocked error bars on the fly for the
total energy and its components, which should agree with the error bars
computed by the reblock utility. However, the utility allows a more
detailed statistical analysis, facilitates visualization of data, allows
the computation of reblocked error bars on other expectation values stored
in the hist files (dipole moments, forces..).

Normal interactive use
----------------------

(1) Get a vmc.hist or dmc.hist file.

(2) Type 'reblock' - program will detect vmc.hist or dmc.hist and act
    appropriately - it will object if both are present.

(3) Answer the questions.

Non-interactive use
-------------------
If you don't want the reblock utility to ask you any questions, then create a
'reblock.in' file containing the data it would normally ask for.

For VMC, this will contain 3 integers on the same line. These are :

units : 1=Ha/molecule, 2=eV/molecule, 3=Ha/atom, 4=eV/atom, 5=kcal/mol (finite)
        1=Ha/primcell, 2=eV/primcell, 3=Ha/atom, 4=eV/atom            (periodic)
        1=Ha/electron, 2=eV/electron, (3=Ex.u/exciton)               (e and e-h)

block length : as it says

interaction type : 1=Ewald, 2=MPC (only relevant if both present in same file)

For DMC, you need 4 integers

units : 1=Ha/molecule, 2=eV/molecule, 3=Ha/atom, 4=eV/atom, 5=kcal/mol (finite)
        1=Ha/primcell, 2=eV/primcell, 3=Ha/atom, 4=eV/atom            (periodic)
        1=Ha/electron, 2=eV/electron, (3=Ex.u/exciton)               (e and e-h)

nstart : compute stats from which line (if 0, then it starts at nequil+1)

nave  : how many lines to average over ('0' to include all remaining data)

block length : as it says
