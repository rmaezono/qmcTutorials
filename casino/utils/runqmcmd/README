RUNQMCMD
--------

Usage
=====
runqmcmd [--help --nproc_dft=I --splitqmc[=N] --startqmc=M
           --dft_only/--qmc_only [<runqmc/runpwscf options>]

  This script is used to automate DMC-MD molecular dynamics calculations using
  CASINO and the PWSCF DFT code (part of the Quantum espresso package -
  available at www.quantum-espresso.org). PWSCF must be version 4.3 or later.

  We need to do restarted DMC calculations for a series of points along a
  DFT trajectory.

  This script works by repeatedly calling the 'runpwscf' and 'runqmc' scripts
  which know how to run CASINO/PWSCF on any individual machine. Almost all
  optional arguments to this script are all the same as for runpwscf/runqmc
  and are passed on automatically to these subsidiary run scripts. Type
  'runpwscf --help' or 'runqmc --help' to find out what these options are.
  There is a short list of optional flags specific to runqmcmd which are
  described below.

  It is assumed that PWSCF lives in ~/espresso and CASINO lives in ~/CASINO.
  There are override options available if this is not the case.

  If you are running on a multi-user machine with an account to be
  charged for the calculations, you might consider aliasing 'runqmcmd' as
  alias runqmcmd="runqmcmd --user.account=CPH005mdt "
  or whatever.

  In general you should do something like the following:

  Setup the PWSCF input ('in.pwscf') and the CASINO input ('input' etc. but no
  wave function file) in the same directory. For the moment we assume you have
  an optimized Jastrow from somewhere (this will be automated later). Have the
  PWSCF setup as 'calculation = "md"', and 'nstep = 100' or whatever. The
  runqmcmd script will then run PWSCF once to generate 100 xwfn.data files,
  then it will run CASINO on each of the xwfn.data. The first will be a proper
  DMC run with full equilibration (using the values of DMC_EQUIL_NSTEP,
  DMC_STATS_NSTEP etc. The second and subsequent steps (with slightly
  different nuclear positions) will be restarts from the previous converged
  config.in - each run will use new keywords DMCMD_EQUIL_NSTEP and
  DMCMD_STATS_NSTEP (with the number of blocks assumed to be 1. The latter
  values are used if new keyword DMC_MD is set to T, and they should be very
  small).

  It is recommended that you set DMC_SPACEWARPING AND DMC_REWEIGHT_CONF to T
  in CASINO input when doing such calculations.

  The calculation can be run through pwfn.data, bwfn.data or bwfn.data.b1
  formats as specified in the pw2casino.dat file (see CASINO and PWSCF
  documentation).

Default behaviour of runqmcmd (on all machines):
-----------------------------

Note : NMDSTEP is the value of the PWSCF input keyword 'nstep', while xwfn.data
refers to whatever wave function file is specified in the pw2casino.dat
file (either bwfn.data.b1 [default], bwfn.data or pwfn.data).

For a complete DMC-MD run, the following three steps are performed in sequence:

(A) Generate NMDSTEP+1 xwfn.data.$ files, where $ is a sequence number from
    0 to NMDSTEP.
(B) Run a full DMC run on xwfn.data.0
(C) Temporarily modify the CASINO input file, by changing DMC_MD from F to T,
    and RUNTYPE from VMC_DMC to DMC_DMC. Run nmdstep restarted QMC runs on
    xwfn.data.1 to xwfn.data.[nmdstep], each restarting from the previous.

On batch queue systems, runqmcmd will by default do *two* batch script
submissions, the first - handled by the runpwscf script - executing step (A),
and the second - handled by the runqmc script - executing steps (B-C).

In principle, this wastes some unnecessary time (the time spent waiting for the
QMC batch script to start) but this is unavoidable if runqmcmd uses separate
runpwscf and runqmc scripts to handle the DFT and QMC calculations. This
may be changed in the future, if anyone can be arsed.

Note that all calculations will be done on the number of cores requested on the
command line (with the --nproc/-p flag) irrespective of whether they are DFT or
QMC calculations. You may override this for the DFT calcs by using the
--nproc_dft flag to runqmcmd.

Modifications to default behaviour (on all machines)
----------------------------------

(1) runqmcmd --dft_only  : execute only step(1), generating NMDSTEP+1
                           xwfn.data.$ files.

Essentially the same thing can be done by executing 'runpwscf --qmc' but doing
that would bypass a few error traps.

(2) runqmcmd --qmc_only  : execute only steps(B-C)

This requires that the NMDSTEP+1 xwfn.data.$ files already exist - if they
don't the script will whinge and die.

(3) runqmcmd --startqmc=M : Start the chain of QMC runs with file xwfn.data.M
    If M=0, the first run will be a full QMC run with DMC_MD=F, otherwise
    if M>0 then all runs will be short restarted ones with DMC_MD=T.
    (Note that for M>0, DMC_MD and RUNTYPE in the input file will be
     'temporarily 'modified' as described above, no matter what values they
    currently have). The resulting sequence M-->NMDSTEP can be split into N
    parts using --splitqmc=N  as before.

Modifications to default behaviour (batch machines only)
----------------------------------

On batch machines, there is an additional complication due to the walltime
limits on particular queues which may require full DMC-MD runs to be
split into sections. The following flags may be used to do this.

(4) runqmcmd --splitqmc : do step A (DFT run), step B (initial QMC run) and
    step C (chain of remaining QMC restarted jobs) as three separate batch
    script submissions (i.e. no longer combine B and C).

(5) runqmcmd --splitqmc=N : As (3) but split step C into N separate batch
    script submissions.

    Example : NMDSTEP=1005, and runqmcmd --splitqmc=4 will result in
    1 step B job plus four sets of step C jobs with 251, 251, 251, 252 steps.
