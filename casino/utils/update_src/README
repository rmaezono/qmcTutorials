# UPDATE_SRC
# ----------
#
# Script to untar new CASINO distribution and update symlinks on any given 
# machine for the majority of users who don't have access to the CASINO
# git repository.
#
# Usage: update_src [-s] <CASINO version number>
#
# This assumes that you wish to follow MDT's practice of keeping multiple 
# versions of CASINO in $HOME with their directories labelled by the version 
# number e.g. CASINO_v2.13.156, with a symbolic link 'CASINO' pointing to the 
# version you are currently using.
#
# This script requires the version number (2.13.156 in the above example)
# to be supplied as a command line argument.
#
# If you wish to point to a 'standard' version of the code (called something
# like CASINO_v2.13.156_standard) rather than the developer version, then
# this can be flagged with the '-s' option. The version number should still
# be written as e.g. 2.13.156 .
#
# The scripts (1) deletes any existing symbolic links called CASINO, but stops
# if CASINO is a real directory, (2) untars a supplied CASINO_v2.13.156.tar.gz 
# archive, (3) renames the resulting 'CASINO' directory as CASINO_v2.13.156, 
# (4) creates a 'CASINO' symlink pointing to the CASINO_v2.13.156 directory. 
# All appropriate error checking is performed at each stage.
#
# Note that you might want to put the script somewhere else in your path, as
# it obviously won't work unless you have compiled the previous CASINO 
# distribution that you're presumably trying to replace.
