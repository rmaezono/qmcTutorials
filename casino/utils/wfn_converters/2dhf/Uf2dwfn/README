The 2DHF to CASINO converter is an executable file that converts output from
the numerical orbital Hartree-Fock diatomic molecule code 2DHF (see
http://fizyka.umk.pl/~jkob/software/2dhf/) to CASINO format. 

Compilation:

This utility is not automatically compiled by the CASINO install system, and
must be compiled manually.

To do this, type './install' in the source directory (this currently assumes
you are using the Intel ifort compiler; you should adjust the script 
accordingly if you want to use some other compiler).

The resulting executable, 'uf2dwfn', is placed in the user bin directory
(~/bin/uf2dwfn - see install).

Usage:

First run 2dhf for the diatomic molecule of interest, and copy input+output
files to names read by converter:

> ~/2dhf/bin/x2dhf < O2.data	 	! Perform HF
> cp 2dhf_output.orb inp.orb		! Copy orbitals file
> cp O2.data         inp.data		! Copy input file

with input file O2.inp as specified in 2DHF documentation. Next run the
converter:

> ~/bin/uf2dwfn				! Convert to CASINO format.

to generate the file dwfn.data for CASINO.

NB: The compilation of ufdwfn.f90 must be consistent with that for 2dhf since
the orbital file (inp.orb) is unformatted. The install script given here is
consistent with the default 2DHF(2005) ifort compilation on a x86_64 linux
machine.
