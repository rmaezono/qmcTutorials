The ATSP2K to CASINO converter is an executable file that converts output
from the numerical orbital multi-determinant (and Hartree-Fock) atomic
package Atsp2K (see
http://nlte.nist.gov/cgi-bin/MCHF/download.pl?d=ATSP2K) to CASINO format.  
At a numerical level the ATSP2K code works with radial orbitals and
Configuration State Functions (CSFs) rather than determinants constructed
from 3-d orbitals, hence this conversion is non-trivial.


Compilation:

This utility is not automatically installed by the CASINO build system, and
must be compiled manually.

To do this, type 'make' in the source directory.

The resulting executable, 'extractdet', is placed in the user bin
directory (~/bin/extractdet - see Makefile).

For compilation to succeed the Atsp2K code must be installed and compiled
(it requires libang.a to be present in $ATSP/lib - see Makefile).


Multideterminant usage:

First run Atsp2k for the isolated atom of interest:

> ~/Atsp2K/bin/hf    < hf.inp    ! Perform initial HF (to provide initial 
                                 ! orbitals for mchf)
> mv wfn.out wfn.inp
> ~/Atsp2K/bin/lsgen < lsgen.inp ! Make set of CSFs
> mv clist.out cfg.inp
> ~/Atsp2K/bin/nonh              ! Make energy expression for set of CSFs
> ~/Atsp2K/bin/mchf  < mchf.inp  ! Perform multi-determinant SCF.

with input files hf.inp, lsgen.inp, and mchf.inp as specified in Atsp2K
documentation. Three resulting files (wfn.out, cfg.inp, and fort.60)
contain the orbitals, CSF specifications, and CSF coefficients to be read
by the converter. Following this:

> ~/bin/extractdet               ! Convert to CASINO format.

generates the files awfn.data and correlation.data_foot that contain
orbitals, determinant specifications, and determinant coefficients in
CASINO format.  The file awfn.data may be supplied to CASINO as is,
whereas correlation.data_foot should be added to a pre-existing
correlation.data file.

All of the determinants present in Atsp2K active space are included in
this input - this can be massive. It is left to the user to modify these
lists should they need to, either by editing the input files supplied to
the converter (cfg.inp, fort.60) or the output files provided by it
(awfn.data, correlation.data_foot).


Hartree-Fock usage:

The converter may be used for HF since this is a multi-determinant
calculation with one determinant. To do so the user supplies a cfg.inp and
fort.60 that specify the one-determinant ground state CSF, and Atsp2K
provides the HF orbitals in wfn.out.

For example, for a neutral ground state Nitrogen atom the user creates
the cfg.inp and fort.60 files by hand, and generates the orbitals using
Atsp2K HF solver:

> echo '\n\n  1s( 2)  2s( 2)  2p( 3)\n 1S0 1S0 4S3 1S  4S\n*' > cfg.inp
> echo '    1   4So\n       1    0.000000000\n  1.0000000'    > fort.60
> ~/Atsp2K/bin/hf                                             < hf.inp
> ~/bin/extractdet

(For the HF case the correlation.data_foot file may be ignored.)



NB: As well as using part of the Atsp2K library, the code evaluates
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and factorials using the anglib.f90 functions
written by Paul Stevenson, Oxford University/Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. anglib.f90 is included in the source supplied.
