How to make this work with ABINIT (until it is included in the official release)
================================================================================

Download ABINIT 4.4.2 from www.abinit.org.

You need to add the outqmc.F90 file from the present directory to the ABINIT
subdirectory /Src_3iovars. Modify the gstate.F90 and driver.F90 files in
/Src_9drive/ so that they look like the ones here (i.e. add the lines surrounded
by ! CASINO comment lines - just a call to the new outqmc routine and the
filling-in of an ABINIT variable that was previously left uninitialized).
Additionally, the object_list file in /Src_3iovars/ must have the line
outqmc.o added to it (like the example here).

Having done this you should then be able to compile ABINIT with 'make abinis'.

There is an example 'input' file set up for silicon and a corresponding 'files'
file to run with 'abinis < files >& log' in the io directory here, which should,
if the modifications have been successful, produce a pwfn.data in the same
directory.

This routine is not yet fully tested and is classified as 'under development'
but it ought to work correctly. Bug reports and problems to MDT.

Have fun with ABINIT.
