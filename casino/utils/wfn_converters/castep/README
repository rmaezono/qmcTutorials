CASTEP 2002 to CASINO converter
-------------------------------

CASTEP is an ab initio plane wave DFT code for the solution of the electronic
ground state of periodic systems. For further information concerning the
code see:

www.castep.org

The basic reference for the code is :

M. D. Segall, P. L. D. Lindan, M. J. Probert, C. J. Pickard, P. J.  Hasnip,
S. J. Clark and M. C. Payne, "First-principles simulation: ideas, illustrations
and the CASTEP code", J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. 14(11) pp.2717-2743 (2002)

The CASINO conversion tool castep2casino is available from the CASINO
download site - in Linux binary form only as the source code is owned by
Accelrys Inc. If you are a UK academic you may have a copy of the source code
under the UKCP agreement - contact a member of the CASTEP Developers Group
(such as Phil Hasnip pjh503@york.ac.uk). If you want a binary for some other
architecture then Phil may also be able to help.

This utility is able to generate 'pwfn.data' files which contains all required
information concerning the wave function, the geometry and the k point net in
a format that CASINO understands.

Support is not currently planned for the old (i.e. pre 2002 total rewrite)
version of CASTEP. If you wish to write a routine to write out a pwfn.data
file from old CASTEP, please do so and send it to mdt26 at cam.ac.uk.


How to create a CASINO pwfn.data file using CASTEP
--------------------------------------------------

1) Download appropriate CASINO atomic wave functions and pseudopotentials from
   the CASINO web site : www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mdt26/casino_library.html .
   Rename awfn.data as *.awfn, e.g. for silicon you should have
   si_pp.data and si_pp.awfn

2) Create .cell and .param files to evaluate the energy of your relaxed
   structure.

   i.e. .param should contain Task: SinglePoint

   .cell should contain e.g. for silicon at the gamma point

   %block species_pot
       Si  si_pp.data
   %endblock species_pot

   %block kpoints_list
    0.0000000000    0.0000000000    0.0000000000    1.0
   %endblock kpoints_list

   Note, kpoints_list can contain any number of k points.

3) Use the checkpoint file from the first calculation for your
   castep2casino conversion. i.e. add the line

   continuation : yourfilename.check

   to the yourfilename.param file then type castep2casino yourfilename

4) Rename yourfilename.casino as pwfn.data and you're ready to go.

   For further information regarding this utility please contact Phil Hasnip
   (pjh503@york.ac.uk) or Chris Pickard (cjp10@st-andrews.ac.uk).
