CFOUR MOLDEN interface
----------------------

CFOUR's implementation of MOLDEN is, uh, special.. and requires various
vectors to be reordered before the standard CASINO molden2qmc converter
will work.

To do this, replace the file /libr/reorderdf.f in the CFOUR distribution
with the one in this directory, then recompile.
