CRYSTAL2003_TO_QMC
==================

For CRYSTAL95 and CRYSTAL98, the separate utility supplied in
CASINO/utils/wfn_converters/crystal9x_to_qmc can be used to generate
gwfn.data files for CASINO.

With the release of CRYSTAL 2003, support for generating gwfn.data file should
be built into the CRYSTAL properties program. The new CRYSTAL module is
included in this directory just for reference.

MDT 11.2003


Update
------

That said, there is currently a problem with this, as Carla Roetti wants
to keep CRYSTAL 'pure' and doesn't want the thing to be included in the main
CRYSTAL program and wants me to convert it into a utility. This is despite
the fact that I was writing it under instructions from Nic Harrison who
told me to write an internal module.

Converting it into a utility is really tedious, since the fort.12 file
used by the 95/98 utility no longer exists, and now in addition I need
the symmetry information to unwrap the orbitals out of the Irreducible
Brillouin zone, which I don't know how to read.

Clearly this is getting really boring, as you can see, and the current
status of the interface is uncertain. Contact me - mdt26 at cam.ac.uk -
for the latest information.

Update 2
--------

The initial release of CRYSTAL03 had a broken pseudopotential
evaluator which gave erroneous results if the powers of r you
you used in the expansion went outside a limited range. Roberto Orlando
has now fixed this. A version of CRYSTAL which contains this fix should
now be available.

Update 3
--------

10.2005 Further attempt to make the CRYSTAL03 interface talk to the new
CRYSTAL API failed. Not enough information provided by the CRYSTAL developers.
Forget it.

Update 4
--------

Use CRYSTAL06 instead!
