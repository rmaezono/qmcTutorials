CRYSTALTOQMC
============

MDT 4.2000

This directory contains a shell script 'crysgen'. This drives the fortran
program 'crystaltoqmc' which converts the fort.12, fort.10 and fort.30 files
produced by CRYSTAL95/CRYSTAL98 into the gwfn.data file required by CASINO.

Note that CRYSTAL2003/2006 use a different method to extract the relevant
data - see the directories ../crystal03 and ../crystal06.

The directory 'crystal_run_script' contains a shell script to run
CRYSTAL95/98/03 (see the header to that file for more details). Note that the
publicly available CRYSTAL 'run' script available from my web site does not
contain the necessary -qmc option. So if you already use that you might need to
replace it with the one supplied here.

You will need to change the environment variable definitions in the run and
crysgen scripts to get the thing to run on your system.

If you want to use your own copy of CRYSTAL95 or CRYSTAL98 to generate
QMC wave functions, you will need to make some minor modifications to the
source code (see the accompanying README_CHANGES file). [You should probably
seek permission from the authors of CRYSTAL before you do this..]


To produce gwfn.data from crystal input file 'dna'
-------------------------------------------------

run -qmc dna   (-qmc flag invokes generation of relevant QMC files in temp)
cd /temp/mdt   (for example - temp directory is that specified in 'run' script)
crysgen        (then answer the questions - your gwfn.data will appear)
rm dna.*       (in temp directory)

NOTE:
CRYSTALTOQMC will ask you for the size of the Monkhorst-Pack k net in the
CRYSTAL calculation, and the desired size of supercell in the QMC calc.
These need not be the same (if not, you are 'plucking') but the former must
be divisible by the latter.

e.g. 12x12x12 MP net in CRYSTAL will allow you to generate gwfn.data files
describing a many-body wave function suitable for 1x1x1,2x2x2,3x3x3,4x4x4,
6x6x6 and 12x12x12 supercell cases.

NOTE 2: For polymer and slab calculations the last one and two numbers
in the MP net and supercell specifications should be 1 to reflect the fact
that the system is not periodic in those dimensions.

e.g. polymer 12 1 1 --> 1 1 1, 2 1 1, 3 1 1, 4 1 1, 6 1 1, 12 1 1
     surface 12 1 1 --> 1 1 1, 2 2 1, 3 3 1, 4 4 1, 6 6 1, 12 12 1

For molecular calculations, just imagine you have a 1x1x1 MP net.
