MOLDEN2QMC
----------

Converts MOLDEN files produced by a variety of external Gaussian basis set 
codes to CASINO gwfn.data format.

This is supposed to provide some level of support for at least the following
software packages: 

MOLPRO, ORCA, PSI-4, TURBOMOLE, C4

Please look at the file CASINO/examples/generic/gauss_dfg/RESULTS to determine
the current level of support for each code.

According to information available on the interwebs, the MOLDEN format is also
supposedly supported in some sense by ACESII, MOLCAS, DALTON, Jaguar, CADPAC,
GEOMOP, and HONDO (whatever they might be) thus it may ultimately be possible
to provide some sort of connection with these codes too if someone should 
desire it. 

Please contact Mike Deible (mjd87@pitt.edu) or Mike Towler (mdt26@cam.ac.uk)
for further information or to report errors.


Some notes:

1.  Not all of the information that CASINO needs is dumped into a MOLDEN
    file by every quantum chemistry code. (MOLPRO is the exception.)
    Because of this, some post-processing after running the converter
    may be necessary. For example, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion enegy
    needs to be retrieved from the quantum chemistry output.  The converter
    will remind you of this, but if you convert your file and try to run CASINO
    without first looking at the produced gwfn.data file, CASINO may not work.

2.  It is VERY IMPORTANT to run a simple VMC run without a Jastrow factor, and 
    be absolutly certain that the VMC energy and the HF energy agree within the 
    error bar.  (If DFT is being used, the VMC energy should be LESS THAN the 
    DFT energy.)

3.  For PP calculations, any atom with Z > 18, it is assumed that the PP 
    removes only the noble gas core (i.e., krypton has a valence charge of 18, 
    not 8 as if the d electrons were removed.)

4.  This script does not currently support sp functions, though I left the 
    space for them if someone is inclined to go add them.  

------------------------- NOTES ON PARTICULAR PROGRAMS -------------------------

    The original idea for a MOLDEN converter was that it would produce a 
    gwfn.data file for any quantum chemistry package, instead of writing a 
    converter for each individual code. Unfortunately, all MOLDEN files are 
    NOT created equally, and so this converter has been tailored to particular 
    codes. Each MOLDEN file has its own subtleties.

********************************** ORCA ****************************************

1.  If ORCA was run on Windows, the produced MOLDEN file will have Windows end 
    of line characters, which means the python script cannot read it. This is 
    simple enough to fix, by simply typing 'dos2unix FILE_NAME'. At some point 
    in the future, I will try to get python to strip the end of line 
    characters, but until then, dos2unix works fine.

2.  For whatever reason, ORCA prints the diffuse functions of an augmented 
    Dunning basis set grouped together, instead of grouped by shell type. This 
    causes the VMC and HF energies to be disagree. I'm fairly certain this is 
     a bug that I have yet to uncover, not an issue with the ORCA output, but 
     be wary.

********************************** Psi-4 ***************************************

1.  Sometimes, this code prints multiple copies of the MOLDEN file to the same 
    file. If this happens, the best choice is the last instance of this file. 
    The converter will stop if this problem is detected. Again, check 
    CAREFULLY that the qauntum chemistry results match with the VMC results.
