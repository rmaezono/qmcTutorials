[MDT NOTE2: Albert Defusco is writing an internal GAMESS converter which is
 intended to supplant this utility. Check documentation for current status..]

latest changes: 1.1.2009

The GAMESS-US to CASINO converter consists of two scripts:

1. gamess2qmc: extracts all relevant Hartree Fock output from GAMESS
2. getdet: extracts the relevant determinant information (In a later
   development, both scripts can be merged in principle.)

Functionality (and limitations):

1. contracted and uncontracted Gaussian basis functions
2. s, p, d basis functions (sp=L basis functions have not been
   implemented yet)
3. symmetry of the nuclear coordinates is understood and automatically
   converted into required information for use in CASINO
4. RHF, ROHF and UHF calculations
5  closed-shell MCSCF calculations (open-shell MCSCF calculations have
   not been implemented yet, should be a small modification only)
6. Determinant-based MCSCF calculations (for configuration state
   function (CSF) based MCSCF, the conversion between GAMESS-US and
   CASINO did not seem to work in some cases; I did not find a general
   solution; the converter is therefore only limited to determinant-based
   MCSCF calculations)
7. some steps still require manual work to generate MCSCF wavefunctions;
   later versions should eliminate that

---------------------- gamess2qmc --------------------------

Usage: gamess2qmc -t hf/opt/nat -l vec.data *.log

The option -t is required. It says what kind of orbitals are read
in. These can be Hartree-Fock orbitals from a Hartree-Fock calculation
(hf), or optimized orbitals (opt) or natural orbitals (nat) from MCSCF
or CI calculation. When natural orbitals are read in, please first
delete the last empty line right after the calculated orbital
coefficients are listed in the *.log file. (This is required for
reading.)

The option -l vec.data is not required. It says that the LCAO
coefficients are re-read from the vec.data file that was previously
written out by GAMESS into the scratch directory. Before the vec.data
file is read, delete all lines by hand that are not required in the
vec.data file before and after the relevant orbital coefficients; In
HF calculations, this option is advisable as the accuracy of the
orbital coefficients is improved. In MCSCF/CI calculations this option
is also advisable to make sure that the correct orbital coefficients
are read in.  If this option is not chosen, the original coefficients
from the *.log file are chosen.

The option -v n, where n is a number between 1 and 5 sets the
verbosity level.  Only relevant for debugging.

!!! Important information for the user !!! In every GAMESS-US
calculation, it is important to set ISPHER=1. GAMESS-US operates with
Cartesian Gaussians and ISPHER=1 restricts these Cartesian Gaussian
as is required to transform them later into Spherical Gaussian for use
in CASINO. This option generally results in a nonzero "NUMBER OF
SPHERICAL CONTAMINANTS DROPPED".

It is also important to check that the "NUMBER OF LINEARLY DEPENDENT
MOS DROPPED" is zero. This is important for the converter to work
properly. If this number is nonzero, try to decrease QMTTOL. A level
that generally seems to work is 1.0E-8.


------------------------- getdet ----------------------------

Usage: getdet -t det -r 0.0001 ci.log
       getdet -t gms -r 0.0001 mcscf.log

The option -t is required and says that determinant information is
extracted from CI output for use in CASINO (det) or that determinant
information is extracted from MCSCF output for re-optimization of the
orbitals in a GAMESS MCSCF calculation (gms).

The option -r 0.0001 is required. It says that determinants with a
coefficient that are larger then 0.0001 are written out.

!!! Important information for the user!!! In mcscf.inp set NORB to the
number of orbitals that are read below (one often forgets to change
that number). When performing long MCSCF calculations, make sure to
set the plot tolerance PRTTOL to a value that is small enough so that
enough determinants are written out. Only use determinant-based MCSCF
calculations as CSF based calculations were found not to give
consistent results within CASINO.


------------------------- example ---------------------------

If you have found this script, you should have also found the example
directory MCSCF_demo. In the following, all steps to achieve a
determinant-based MCSCF run in CASINO are explained and all files are
given in the directory.



1. --- HF calculation ---

rungms rhf 01 1 > rhf.log

(01 is the GAMESS version number and 1 the number of nodes)

mv /scratch/ab582/rhf.dat .

cp rhf.dat vec.dat

vi vec.dat and delete all information before and after the orbital
coefficients

gamess2qmc -t hf -l vec.dat rhf.log

the gwfn.data file is written out

Now, perform a VMCHF calculation (a VMC calculation without a Jastrow
factor) to check if you get the right HF energy. My example file
contains the pseudopotential file for N that I generated from the
Gaussian expansion parameters from the DF pseudopotential
(see www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mdt26/casino2_pseudopotentials.html).
This guarantees that all GAMESS and CASINO calculations are performed
with the same pseudopotential and we can expect that the HF (or later
MCSCF) results from GAMESS to agree with those from CASINO if the
conversion works properly.

In the example:

GAMESS gives -19.3791   Ha
CASINO gives -19.380(2) Ha

which agrees within one standard error. If the conventional
"tabulated" pseudopotential is used from the website (and differs
from the one used here), difference between the GAMESS results and
CASINO results may arise that can be as large as several mHa. This is
avoided here.



2. --- MCSCF calculation ---

rungms mcscf 01 1 > mcscf.log

getdet -t gms -r 0.05 writes out the file gamess.data

 $GCILST
2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
write the number 6 into a new second line of this file and delete this line
 $END

This file needs to be edited by hand. First, copy the number 6 into a news
second line and delete the penultimate line

 $GCILST
6 2
2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
 $END

Also, I have written a second number (2) after 6 in the second
line. Please read the GAMESS manual for different values. I think 1 is
the default (when omitted) and says that full symmetry is applied. To
my experience, this only works when all orbitals are doubly occupied
(when all space group lines are deleted that contain 1).

Also, when a 0 appears in an entire column vector (molecular orbital)
over all space representations, they must be deleted, otherwise
GAMESS has difficulties.

 $GCILST
6 2
2 2 2 2 0 0
2 2 0 2 2 0
2 2 2 0 0 2
2 2 1 1 1 1
0 2 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 0 2
 $END

Now, create a new mcscf_again.inp file that contains that $GCILST
block.  The orbital coefficients can remain the same from the previous
HF calculation.

rungms mcscf_again 01 1 > mcscf_again.log



3. --- CI calculation ---

Due to a bug in the GAMESS routine, we need to do a CI calculation in
order to obtain the appropriate MCSCF orbital coefficients. If you may
want to understand that in more detail, the GAMESS MCSCF output states
"IF YOU WISH TO SEE CI EXPANSIONS BASED ON THE CANONICAL (OR NATURAL) ORBITALS,
YOU MUST RUN A CI CALCULATION WITH THAT ORBITAL CHOICE READ IN $VEC."

Therefore, copy all relevant information into a new ci.inp file and
type

rungms ci 01 1 > ci.log

The computed CI energy should be compared with the previous MCSCF energy. In my
experience, they always agree up to the last decimal place. Then type

getdet -t det -r 0.00000 ci.log

The last execution reads all determinant coefficients from the ci.log file and
writes them into a file det.data:

Take that block and paste it into the gwfn.data file where the following
information stands:

MULTIDETERMINANT INFORMATION
----------------------------
GS


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note added by R. Dawes - May 22 2014

The phases of the optimized MCSCF orbitals are often switched by GAMESS during
the CI calculation.  This means that the outputted MULTIDETERMINANT INFORMATION
will be inconsistent with the orbital coefficients obtained by processing the
mcscf output.  The answer is to process the orbitals as they appear in the CI
calculation output.  However, in the CI calc output they are not labeled
correctly to be processed by the "gamess2qmc" script and therefore must be
renamed.  The following example command will relabel them from the file
"N2_ci.log" from "INITIAL GUESS ORBITALS" to "MCSCF OPTIMIZED ORBITALS" (which
they are with some phase changes).

sed -e 's/INITIAL GUESS ORBITALS$/MCSCF OPTIMIZED ORBITALS/' -e 's/^.*END OF INITIAL.*$/DONE WITH MCSCF ITERATIONS/' N2_ci.log > n2.gamess

Processing the relabeled CI output with the "gamess2qmc" and "getdet" scripts
will produce correct energies in subsequent VMC and DMC calculations.
(inconsistent phases causes huge jumps in the energies)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Finally, you are ready to run a CASINO calculation.

For testing, the following results are obtained:

GAMESS gives: -19.4742
CASINO gives: -19.470(3)

which agrees within one standard error.

Some additional information: the information that is written out on
the screen by the script getdet is useful to check that the conversion
worked. E.g.

        DET 10 1 PR 4 1 7 1
        DET 10 2 PR 5 1 6 1
det in CASINO   2375-2-3-4-6
made consistent 2357-2-3-4-6  casino_phase -1

The first two lines specify the format for determinant 10 as required by
CASINO. The third line gives another representation of that same determinant
(the positive numbers correspond to molecular orbitals with alpha spin and the
negative numbers correspond to molecular orbitals with beta spin). The fourth
line gives the representation of that same determinant after the columns have
been commuted as required. The corresponding phase factor is written out that
is later on multiplied with the determinant coefficient.
