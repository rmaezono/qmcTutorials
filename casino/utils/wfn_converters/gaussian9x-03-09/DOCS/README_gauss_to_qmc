G9xtoqmc
========

(See the notes in the CASINO manual - much more extensive than these (MDT))

The g9xtoqmc program is a utility to read the results of a Gaussian94/98/03/09
calculation and output the resulting wavefunction in a form compatible with
CASINO.  The code *requires* the existance of a formatted checkpoint file
(produced by putting FormCheck=(MO,Basis) in the route section of the Gaussian
job file).  It expects this file to have a '.Fchk' suffix ('.fchk for
Gaussian09). The output file of the Gaussian job is also  *required*.  It is
assumed that this has a '.out' suffix.  If the original Gaussian job file is
present then it will be appended to the end of the QMC input file.

Basically, if you have a Gaussian job file called dna (say) and run it to
produce dna.out and Test.FChk then you must:

mv Test.fchk dna.fchk
run g9xtoqmc ... and follow prompts
mv dna.qmc gwfn.data

which may be then be used as input to a CASINO calculation.

The code should automatically detect what sort of Gaussian job it is
and give you the opportunity to construct an excited-state
wavefunction if applicable.

It can deal with the following sorts of calculation:

  HF and DFT ground states, open and closed shell.
  CIS excited states, open and closed shell.
  CASSCF states.
  Time-dependent HF or DFT excited states.

If the user chooses to output a CIS, CASSCF or TD-DFT wavefunction, they are
given the option of resumming it.

Note that although more recent versions of Gaussian contains a limited
facility for treating periodic systems, the gaussiantoqmc
converter does not support this, since it was written before the periodic
functionality was introduced. People who wish to do this should use the
(superior) CRYSTAL program instead (or volunteer to update the converter).
