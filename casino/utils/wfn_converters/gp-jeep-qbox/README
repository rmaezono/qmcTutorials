GP - JEEP - QBOX
----------------

We used to support an old Lawrence Livermore code which, when we played with it
years ago, was called GP. It also appears to have been called JEEP, and has now
morphed into something called QBOX which has a website at
eslab.ucdavis.edu/software/qbox/index.htm .

This directory contains a converter called 'jeep_to_pwfn' which used to read in
'jeep.wf' and 'atoms.sys' files to produce a CASINO pwfn.data file. It is
highly unlikely that this still works with modern versions of QBOX. If anyone
out there would like to update this information, or to make the converter work
in a modern context, then they would be very welcome.
