MCEXX-CASINO interface
======================

MCEXX is a code written by A. Goerling, S. Rohra, P. Carrier, A.  Hesselmann,
H. Schulz and E. Trushin at the University Erlangen Nuremberg in Germany. It is
a plane wave electronic structure code for conventional Kohn-Sham calculations
(LDA/GGAs), Hartree-Fock calculations, DFT calculations with hybrid
functionals, exact-exchange (EXX) Kohn-Sham calculations, and calculations
treating electron correlation within the random phase approximation. Spin-orbit
interactions, non-collinear spin, and accompanying magnetization currents can
be treated. With explicitly temperature-dependent functionals calculations for
the the very high temperatures relevant in warm dense matter physics (e.g. in
the context of nuclear fusion or matter in stars) can be carried out. 

An interface between MCEXX and CASINO was implemented in November 2013 but this
is not publically distributed nor included in the CASINO distribution.
