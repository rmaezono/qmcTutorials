A python script to convert MOLDEN files produced by a variety of external 
Gaussian basis set codes to CASINO gwfn.data format.

This is supposed to provide support for at least the following software
packages: 

CFOUR, DALTON, MOLPRO, ORCA, PSI-4, TURBOMOLE

and possibly others that also support the MOLDEN file format (QCHEM and NWCHEM
are being looked at..).

Please look at the file CASINO/examples/generic/gauss_dfg/RESULTS to determine
the current level of support for each code.

According to information available on the interwebs, the MOLDEN format is also
supposedly supported in some sense by ACESII, MOLCAS, Jaguar, CADPAC, GEOMOP,
and HONDO (whatever they might be) thus it may ultimately be possible to
provide some sort of connection with these codes too if someone should desire
it. 

A tester script - test_molden2qmc.py - is also supplied, for which instructions
are not currently provided. Note that this is not setup by the utils Makefile
as it requires a bunch of Vladimir assumptions about what files are present
to run it.

To use the converter, sit in a directory containing MOLDEN output for the code
of interest, type 'molden2qmc', then follow the prompts.

Please contact -- in order of preference -- the following people for further 
information or to report errors:

Some notes:

1.  It is VERY IMPORTANT to run a simple VMC run without a Jastrow factor, and 
    be absolutely certain that the VMC energy and the HF energy agree within 
    the error bar.  (If DFT is being used, the VMC energy should be LESS THAN 
    the DFT energy.)

2.  This script does not currently support sp functions, though space has been 
    left for them if someone is inclined to go add them. Vladimir says: 
    "Looking in Molden specs http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/molden_format.html
    one can read that: For 'sp' shells two contraction coefficients must be 
    given.. I can say for sure that molden2qmc does not support this format, 
    but I was not able to generate such molden file. Even when I take 3-21G 
    basis in ORCA, s and p basis in the molden file are separated. I'd be very 
    grateful if you could tell me how to get the MOLDEN file with sp shells." 
    Thus this may or may not be a problem.

------------------------- NOTES ON PARTICULAR PROGRAMS -------------------------

    The original idea for a MOLDEN converter was that it would produce a 
    gwfn.data file for any quantum chemistry package, instead of writing a 
    converter for each individual code. Unfortunately, all MOLDEN files are 
    NOT created equally, and so this converter has been tailored to particular 
    codes. Each MOLDEN file has its own subtleties.

********************************** CFOUR ***************************************

1. CFOUR's implementation of MOLDEN is somewhat special.. and requires various
   vectors to be reordered before the standard CASINO molden2qmc converter will
   work. To do this, replace the file /libr/reorderdf.f in the CFOUR distribution
   with the file utils/wfn_converters/cfour/reorderdf.f from the CASINO
   distribution, then recompile CFOUR.

********************************** ORCA ****************************************

1.  If ORCA was run on Windows, the produced MOLDEN file will have Windows end 
    of line characters, which means the python script cannot read it. This is 
    simple enough to fix, by simply typing 'dos2unix FILE_NAME'. At some point 
    in the future, I will try to get python to strip the end of line 
    characters, but until then, dos2unix works fine.

2.  For whatever reason, ORCA prints the diffuse functions of an augmented 
    Dunning basis set grouped together, instead of grouped by shell type. This 
    causes the VMC and HF energies to be disagree. I'm fairly certain this is 
    a bug that I have yet to uncover, not an issue with the ORCA output, but 
    be wary. [Mike Deible] Not able to reproduce this [Vladimir Konjkov].

********************************** Psi-4 ***************************************

1.  If you do geometry optimizations, this code prints multiple copies of the 
    MOLDEN output to the same file. The last one is the one you want, but 
    to avoid this, just do the total energy calculation without optimizing
    the geometry.  The converter should stop if you fail to notice this.
