BLIP.f90
========

This program transforms plane waves into blips. It reads the file
'pwfn.data' and produces the file 'bwfn.data' (this is not necessary
with some codes such as PWSCF which are capable of producing bwfn.data
files directly).

The quality of the blip expansion can be increased with the
input parameter 'xmul'. This results in an increasing number
of blip coefficients, so a larger memory occupancy in CASINO
(but the CPU time should be the same).

To test the quality of the blip expansion set 'ltest = .t.'.
The program then samples the wavefunction, the Laplacian and
the gradient at 1000 points in the simulation cell and computes
the quantity:

                  < bw | pw >
alpha = ------------------------------
       sqrt( < bw | bw > < pw | pw > )

the closer to 1 this quantity the better the representation.
Increasing xmul one should always be able to get alpha as
close to one as wanted.

The program works with Gamma calculations, k points calculations and with
real or complex coefficients.

The gain in speed with respect to plane waves is of the order
of NPW/64
