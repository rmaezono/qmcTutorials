MERGE_PWFN
==========

OBSOLETE

Old versions of PWSCF (from February 2004 to sometime in 2010) were capable of
writing out CASINO-formatted wavefunction files directly, but often
produced a set of separate pwfn.datax [x=1,2,...] - one for each processor.
This merge_pwfn.f90 utility was used to merge all of these together into a
single pwfn.data file.

PWSCF will now do this all by itself, so this utility is no longer required.
