Notes for using runpwscf on specific machines
=============================================

Darwin - woodcrest partition
----------------------------

You need to load the OpenMPI library on login (on the bindloe nodes the default
environment picks up the Qlogic MPI libraries which are the best choice for
running on the older Woodcrest/Qlogic InfiniPath sector of the cluster.)

So have the following in your bashrc:

module purge
module load default-infinipath
module load openmpi

Espresso/PWSCF will then be compiled with OpenMPI by using the
standard './configure ; make all'.

This is suboptimal, but because of the way runpwscf deals with architecture
issues both CASINO and PWSCF must use the same MPI library.

We cannot switch CASINO to using the QLogic MPI library since it does not
support MPI-2 which CASINO requires.


Jaguar
------

Note that as of July 2011 the standard Quantum Espresso/PWSCF 4.3.1 will no
longer compile with the pathscale compiler using

./configure ARCH=crayxt4
make all

stopping at the configure stage bitching about the linking to C programs.

Until someone further investigates further, the best way to get round this
is to use the PGI compiler..
